# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was built to assist new students as they begin their journey in web development. 
I learned how to utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and connect them so they function together. 
Also, using Git & GitHub to save my codebase while implementing new features.
